            <p>Welcome to Waliko CarHire Company. By using our car rental services, you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions. Please read them carefully before proceeding with any rental.</p>

<p><strong>1. Eligibility and Rental Requirements</strong></p>
<p>To rent a vehicle from Waliko CarHire Company, you must be at least 21 years old and hold a valid, non-expired driver’s license. For certain premium vehicles, drivers must be at least 25 years old. Expired or invalid licenses will not be accepted, and failure to provide a valid license at the time of rental will result in cancellation without a refund. Additional requirements, such as a security deposit or additional identification, may be requested based on the rental location and vehicle type.</p>

<p><strong>2. Booking and Payment</strong></p>
<p>All vehicle bookings must be made in advance either via our website or at our rental offices. A valid credit or debit card is required to secure your booking. Payments for the rental, including any applicable deposits, taxes, and fees, must be completed at the time of booking or upon vehicle pick-up, as specified in your rental agreement.</p>

<p><strong>3. Vehicle Use and Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>The vehicle must be used in compliance with all local traffic laws and regulations. You agree to use the vehicle responsibly and solely for lawful purposes. Waliko CarHire Company is not liable for any misuse, accidents, or damages that occur while the vehicle is used in violation of these terms.</p>

<p><strong>4. Rental Period and Return Policy</strong></p>
<p>Your rental period begins when you take possession of the vehicle and ends upon its return to the designated location. Timely return is essential; late returns may incur additional charges. The vehicle should be returned in the same condition as it was rented, except for normal wear and tear. In case of damage, additional fees may apply based on repair costs.</p>

<p><strong>5. Insurance and Liability</strong></p>
<p>All rental vehicles come with basic insurance coverage. However, renters are responsible for any damages, theft, or accidents not covered under the insurance policy. Additional insurance coverage may be purchased at the time of booking for extra protection.</p>

<p><strong>6. Fuel Policy</strong></p>
<p>All vehicles are rented with a full tank of fuel and must be returned with a full tank. Failure to do so may result in refueling charges. The exact fuel policy will be specified in the rental agreement.</p>

<p><strong>7. Cancellations and Refunds</strong></p>
<p>Reservations can be canceled at any time; however, cancellation fees may apply based on the time of cancellation. Refund policies vary based on the type of booking and will be outlined in your rental agreement.</p>

<p><strong>8. Breakdown and Assistance</strong></p>
<p>In case of vehicle breakdown, Waliko CarHire Company provides 24/7 roadside assistance. Renters must contact our support team immediately if they experience any mechanical issues. Unauthorized repairs are strictly prohibited.</p>

<p><strong>9. Termination of Agreement</strong></p>
<p>Waliko CarHire Company reserves the right to terminate the rental agreement and reclaim the vehicle at any time if the renter is found violating the terms and conditions. No refunds will be issued in such cases.</p>

<p><strong>10. Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>All personal information provided during the booking process is kept confidential and used solely for rental purposes. We do not share customer information with third parties except as required by law.</p>
